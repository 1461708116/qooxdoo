    In this tutorial, we want to build a simple login form containig a textfield for the username and a password field for the password. Additionally, a button for the loging is needed.
  </p>
  <h3>Create the Form</h3>
  <p>
    Forms are abstract objects in qooxdoo which hold the input fields and buttons. As we need two input field, we should create them as well. After that, we can add these input fields to the form, as you can see in the following code snippet.
  </p>
  <pre>var form = new qx.ui.form.Form();

var userName = new qx.ui.form.TextField();
form.add(userName, "Name");

var password = new qx.ui.form.PasswordField();
form.add(password, "Password");</pre>
  <p>
    Running this code creates the form, but does not show anything in the app. As described above, forms are abstract objects and do not contain any information on how to layout the form on the screen. Therefore, form renderer can be used.
  </p>
  <h3>Render the Form</h3>
  <p>
    Take a simple, one column rendere and render the form.
  </p>
  <pre>this.getRoot().add(
  new qx.ui.form.renderer.Single(form),
  {left: 10, top: 10}
);</pre>
  <p>
    Running these two code snippets will render a simple form showing the two input fields. You can also see lables in front of each form item shoing the name we gave them with the add call. Give it a try and enter some values or even rename the lables in the code and run it once more.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="step2">
  <h3>Add the Button</h3>
  <p>
    As a next step, we want to add the login button. For adding buttons, the form offers a separate method, which will be used in the folloing snippet.
  </p>
  <pre>var login = new qx.ui.form.Button("Login");
form.addButton(login);</pre>
  <p>
    Copy this code in from of the form rendering to make sure the renderer knows about the button. Run and see the new added Login button.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the button does not do much right now. We should add a listener to validate the form and send the login. Of course, sending data would extend the tutorial too much so we simply show an alert.
  </p>
  <pre>login.addListener("execute", function() {
  if (form.validate()) {
    alert("send...");
  }
});</pre>
  <p>
    Appending these code lines to the bottom of the whole sample will attach a listner to the button, which will be executed on click but also on pressing enter when the button is focused. As you can see in the code, we only show the alert in case the validaion reported back as valid.
  </p>
</div>
<div id="step3">
  <h3>Set up the validation</h3>
  <p>But we did not any information how to validate the input fields. We ue two simple cases, the username is required and the password field should at least have 6 characters.</p>
  <p>
    Setting the username as reuqired is really easy. Just tell the username input to be required.
  </p>
  <pre>userName.setRequired(true);</pre>
  <p>
    Adding this line right after creating the text field will mark the field as required. Running the code now will show you a little red start right beside the name of the field which marks it as required. Hitting the login button now without a user name will fail and highlight the input. Hovering will show a popup containing the error message.
  </p>
  <h3>Custom validation</h3>
  <p>
    Adding a custom validator is also easy. Search for the line where we add the password field to the form and add a function as third parameter. This function will be your validator. The validator will have access to the current set value as first argument. The new line could look like this.
  </p>
  <pre>form.add(password, "Password", function(data) {
  return !!(data && data.length >= 6);
});</pre>
  <p>
    After you have replaced the initlal add with the new one, give it a try and see that also the password field is needs to be filled. But hovering the filed does not show an error message. But we can add one in a single line of code.
  </p>
  <pre>password.setInvalidMessage("Password too short.");</pre>
  <p>
    Adding this line after the password filed should also fix that issue.
  </p>
