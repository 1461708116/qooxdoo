Installation and Setup
***********************

Installation of qooxdoo components is easy. First, go to the `download section <http://qooxdoo.org/download>`_ and grab a suitable package for your purpose. It is either just downloading a library file and placing it in a URL-addressable path in your development environment. Or, in the case of the SDK, download the SDK and unzip it to a suitable path on your hard disk. For further information please refer to specific sections of the qooxdoo component you want to work with. There, you will also find simple, introductory examples that show you how to get started working with the component.


Disk Space
==========

Disk requirements will vary largely depending on the component you chose, with the library files usually small in footprint. The unpacked SDK will require around **%{sdk_unpacked} MB** disk space (most of this is due to media files, like images).

The tool chain also uses a directory in your system's TMP path, to cache intermediate results and downloaded files. Depending on your activities this cache directory can become between **%{cache_average_min}** and **%{cache_average_max} GB** in size. If the `default cache path <http://qooxdoo.org/documentation/general/snippets#finding_your_system-wide_tmp_directory>`__ does not suite you, you can change it in your configuration.
