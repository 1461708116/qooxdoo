=============

* generate either "production" or "development" version (i.e. not including QxDebug.js, etc.)
* QxDebug.js initializes window._start which is used in QxApplication.js as well.
* global image path (theming?)
* optimize opacity property handling in QxWidget
* optimize overflow property handling in QxWidget
* Mozilla oninput event for textchanges in textfields
  http://www.xulplanet.com/references/elemref/ref_EventHandlers.html
* Better handling of atoms with images, send invalidate on image loading complete
* Add Max OSX Theme
* Add Themes with property manipulation support (script)
* Blur by pressing TAB in QxComboBox should not select current item
* Complete atom2 widget, try to move it to other widgets which extend atom currently
* Fix tab layout if layouted on bottom side
* Optimize event objects, copy data from event managers (target, related target, etc. - omit double evaluation)
* We need something like a getScrollBar event to fix layout of the previous rendered children.
