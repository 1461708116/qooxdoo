- provide simple formatting, e.g. alignment, in progressive.table.cell.Default

- disposers in all classes
  - do we need an unjoin() to counter join(), to clear all of the references
    to Progressive? 

- convert to use appearances instead of hard-coded styles

- port Table's cell renderers to be usable by Progressive's tables

- write an example of a Remote data model class

- show how to use Progressive to implement incremental loading of a page
  including a progress indicator.

- add lots of documentation

- Someone will have to test this in Safari.
